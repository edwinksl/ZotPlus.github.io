Better BibTeX bundles 8 translators:

| Translator | Auto-Export? |   |
| ---------- | ------------ | - |
| *Better BibLaTeX* | yes | Exports references in BibLaTeX format (but better, natch) |
| *Better BibTeX*   | yes | Exports and imports references in BibTeX format |
| *Pandoc JSON*     | yes | Exports references in pandoc-compatible CSL-JSON format |
| *BibTeX AUX Scanner* |  | Import-only translator that can read AUX files to put references you cited in a LaTeX document in a collection, and a note for references cited but not in your Zotero library |
| *LaTeX Citation*  |     | Exports citations to be copy-pasted into your LaTeX document in the form `\cite{< key >}` |
| *Pandoc Citation* |     | Exports citations to be copy-pasted into your Markdown document in the form `[@key]` |
| *Collected Notes* | yes | Exports input-able LaTeX out of notes (only). Has no `\begin{document}` etc -- it's not a standalone document |
| *BetterBibTeX JSON* |   | Exports and imports references in BetterBibTeX debug format. The error reporter uses this format |
