* Integration with **[Report Customizer](citation-keys.html)**
* Integration with **[Zotfile](citation-keys.html)**

* **[Pull export](pull-export.html)** from the embedded webserver
* **[Automated export](pull-export.html)** of collections to keep your .bib files all fresh
* Automatic **[journal abbreviation](citation-keys.html)** to bring BibTeX export on par with the Word integration
